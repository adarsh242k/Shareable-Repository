This is a project which was originally done by Amrita Mukherjee (affilated to IISER Berhampur and NISER - India).
My role in the project was assisting in the project and involving in the understanging of the algorithm out of interest.

The codes submitted here can be considered as another version of the actual project.

The two files-
1. 'Getting into convolution using Shapelet formalism.ipynb' gives a rough work for the understanding of the process.
2. 'Testing convolution using Shapelet formalism-Copy1.ipynb' gives a test of the process on an actual star image.
The sample star image (FITS file) can be found in the directory.
