These are a set of primitive codes that were written by me during my first exposure to FITS images and 'playing' with them.
The files broadly have codes for - 
1. Cleaning FITS images
2. Scanning an image to detect bright objects
3. Listing and saving them

A few of the codes might be tedious and can be modified in a smarter way (as they were written at an early stage of my 'coding with Python life'.
